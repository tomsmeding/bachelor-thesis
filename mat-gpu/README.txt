Large-integer matrix multiplication on the GPU.

gmp.h is the header from the exact version of the source tree that
libgmp_asm_tuned.a was compiled from, which is GMP 6.1.2. It's compiled for Arch
Linux somewhere around May 2018.

You'll need CUDA to compile this, because it runs on NVIDIA GPU's. Has been
tested using CUDA 9.1.
